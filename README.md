# FlutterFoodJournal

A Flutter app where the user inputs what food they ate and when. Made this to familiarize myself with Flutter and Dart. Database used is Hive.

# TODO
- Create screen to edit and delete food journal entry
- Style the app so it does not look like a trainwreck
- Add feature where user can define their own category
- Import/Export all entries to csv
